The PEP8 guidelines for code readability include the following:

*  Four spaces for indentation
*  Blank lines to separate functions and classes 
*  Spaces around operators and after commas

The PEP8 coding conventions for consistency and manageability include:

*  Add larger blocks of code inside functions
*  Name functions and files using lowercase with underscores
*  Name classes using CamelCase
*  Name constants in capital letters with underscores separating words

To ensure that your code adheres to the predefined style and standard without executing the code, you can use the Static code analysis method.

<P>

Unit testing is a method to validate if code units are operating as designed. You must test every unit before integration with the final codebase.

To create a package:
*  Create a folder with the package name
*  Create an empty __init__.py file
*  Create the required modules
*  In the __init__.py file, add code to reference the modules needed in the package

You can verify the package via the bash terminal in a Python shell.
